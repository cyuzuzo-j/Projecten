# Projecten
Hello, welcome to my repository. This website showcases a subset of my projects. Please note that most of these projects were not originally intended for publication and may lack sufficient documentation for others to use or understand them.If you have limited time i would encourage you to look at Peno2,drivers license and BtcBot.
## University
* ### [Peno2](https://github.com/cyuzuzo-j/BeanBotApp)
  This project entailed the construction of an autonomous robot capable of delivering beans from a certain reservoir to another one. In this endeavor, my role was to develope a Android application and the Arduino code. The code I developed included the front-end of the application and facilitated communication with the Arduino via HTTP.<br/>

* ### Peno3:
In this group project, we engineered a soft robot. To monitor the robot’s status, I developed a user interface that can display the current state of each valve and provide a camera feed. This application was constructed using React.
(code coming online soon)

## Personal
* ### [drivers license](https://github.com/cyuzuzo-j/rijbewjis)
This is a Python script designed to continuously monitor the availability of driver’s license appointments. The script is capable of significantly reducing the waiting time for an appointment from several months to just a few weeks.
(This script was developed within a span of half an hour, hence the quality of the code may not be optimal.)

* ### [Arch linux](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyuzuzo-j/Projecten/main/ui_screenshot.png?token=GHSAT0AAAAAACN2RUVICR6LMW2VPHUAURAOZPKIS6A)
I have constructed an arch instalation that is visually appealing, efficient, and moderately lightweight. This was achieved by utilizing Hyprland and a variety of other relatively new and lesser-known applications. I find this operating system to be highly useful and it has become a part of my daily computing routine.

I find this operating system to be highly useful and it has become a part of my daily computing routine. The use of these innovative tools has greatly contributed to the system’s performance and aesthetics.

* ### [Level Sensor]
I am currently working on a project that involves developing an application to monitor the water level in my garden’s well. The hardware for this project, an industrial-grade water level sensor, which is connected to an ESP32 board. This board will host a set of APIs that the application can interface with. While the design of the application is still underway, the hardware component of the project is already complete.

## old Personal
This is a small subset of the projects I attempted in high school. While they are conceptually interesting, the quality of the code/repository is very poor.

### machine learning
* #### [Connect4:](https://github.com/cyuzuzo-j/Connect4)
This project was an attempt to create a bot capable of playing Connect4 at a decent level using deep Q-learning. Although it never fully succeeded, it marked the beginning of a series of projects where I explored the application of deep reinforcement learning in various domains.
* #### [BtcBot:](https://github.com/cyuzuzo-j/btcbot4.0)
In this project, I am attempting to utilize an autoencoder to develop a practical compressor and dataset generator. This tool will be instrumental in a future project where I plan to employ reinforcement learning for trading cryptocurrencies. In an earlier version of this project, I endeavored to construct a [trading bot](https://github.com/cyuzuzo-j/cryptobot) using a basic policy gradient, but regrettably, it was unsuccessful. I acknowledge that creating a fully functional bot is likely an unattainable goal.<br/>
### Etc
* #### DroneControl:
This is a project where I attempted to control a drone using a gyroscope and a Raspberry Pi. The special aspect of this project is that at the start of the program, you calibrate the different directions by making a random hand movement. This data is then used to train a neural network that converts the raw data from the gyroscope into drone movements during flight.
* ####  Spotify->mp4
This is a project where I have written a script that converts a Spotify playlist into mp4 files.
